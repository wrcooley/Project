My prototype is in HTML. Start from index.html, and view the page in Google Chrome developer mode (F12) with iPhone 6/7/8 PLUS for device. It will not look correct if viewed in standard desktop form or a different device.

Alternatively, just go to the github-pages link for this project, wrcooley.github.io/Project. Again use Chrome developer mode with iPhone 6/7/8 Plus.

This project is an app that will speed up grocery store visits by finding the fastest path to gather your items. It has a shopping list function the user can edit at any time, and then a shopping mode where they user will be shown navigation to the next item. 
Intended users are anyone who visits a grocery store, but especially people who typically buy many items at once, such as people who live far from a store, parents with large families, or people hosting parties. The needs of these groups are efficiency, as backtracking across the entire store multiple times could waste a lot of time.
